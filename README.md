## Sintrop: A Blockchain for Social and Environmental Impact Applications

Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly impact the fight against climate change
and humanityâ€™s social problems, many different applications are possible to be built with smart
contracts. The problem is that decentralized blockchains process very few transactions per second,
so projects with real-world impact need to compete for transactions with memecoins, NFTs and
others speculative low-value tokens and projects. This competition increases gas fees, limiting the number of impact business models able to operate. What is needed is a decentralized blockchain
infrastructure focused on applications that can make the world better. We propose a public peer-to-peer impact blockchain, running with proof-of-work consensus algorithm with the aim of
operating mostly with renewable energy.

   guidelines (i.e. uses [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/)).
 * Code must be documented adhering to the official Go [commentary](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary)
   guidelines.
 * Pull requests need to be based on and opened against the `master` or `release` branch.
 * Commit messages should be prefixed with the package(s) they modify.
   * E.g. "eth, rpc: make trace configs optional"
